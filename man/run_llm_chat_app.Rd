\description{
Launches the Shiny application as a Gadget in the RStudio Viewer pane,

\examples{
\dontrun{
# This function launches an interactive Shiny gadget.
# It should be run in an interactive R session, preferably within RStudio.

# Ensure necessary setup like the OpenAI API key environment variable
# might be needed for the application's full functionality once launched.
# Sys.setenv(OPENAI_API_KEY = "your_actual_openai_api_key")

# Launch the application
run_llm_chat_app()

# The application will open in the RStudio Viewer or a separate window.
# Interaction happens within the app's UI.
# To stop the app, you might need to close its window or stop the R process
# if run directly in the console, or click the 'X' button in the app's UI.
