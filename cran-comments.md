## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs. 

There was 1 NOTE:
* checking for future file timestamps ... NOTE
  unable to verify current time

This seems to be a common NOTE on Windows systems and can likely be ignored.

## Submission Notes
This is the first release of PacketLLM to CRAN.

PacketLLM requires an OpenAI API key set as the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment 
variable to function correctly. This requirement is documented in the README 
and the vignette.

Functions and examples that require API access or internet connectivity are 
wrapped in `\dontrun{}` blocks in the documentation examples. 
Unit tests requiring API access are skipped on CRAN using `testthat::skip_on_cran()` 
(or are designed not to call the API directly, e.g., by testing helper functions).

Thank you for considering PacketLLM.
